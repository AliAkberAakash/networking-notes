<div class="ans"><p>
There are several design issues that should be considered for creating an efficient network. Some of them are described below :
</p>
<h4>1.Effective Network Planning</h4>
<p>The first step in effective network design and installation is planning. The growth of your business will depend greatly on choosing the best design and installation services. Effective network planning will determine the results that you get and it will involve defining your business needs, establishing your strategies and having clear policies that will help to achieve the goals.</p>
<h4>2.Security</h4>
<p>Securing a network from outside intrusion or data theft is a primary concern for many companies.
Designing a network with hard-wired Ethernet connections eliminates the risk of intrusion to only those with physical access to the network. Unfortunately, this risk expands dramatically when the local network is connected to the Internet.
</p>
<h4>3.Backup</h4>
<p>Redundancy is a critical component, because it ensures that your network essentially has a safeguard in place. No matter the size of the organization, using multiple servers is a smart move. Having redundant components in place is a wise tool in case anything goes down.</p>
<h4>4.Cost</h4>
<p>
Equipment and maintenance costs are often the first consideration in network design. Fortunately, the cost of hubs, routers and switches are relatively low when compared to the early days of networking. Other items that need to be taken into consideration when designing a network include cabling and labor.
</p>
<h4>5.Future Growth</h4>
<p>
When designing a network, it’s important to account for the future. If the business is rapidly expanding, you should factor growth into the design to account for an increase in users. An increase in employees means a more crowded and diverse network.
