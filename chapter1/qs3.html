<p>
Data communications are the exchange of data between two devices using one or multiple forms of transmission medium.The devices which are in need to be a part of a data communication network made up of computer hardware and software.
</p>
<p>Following are the five components of a data communication network.</p>
<ul>
<li>Data</li>
<li>Sender</li>
<li>Receiver</li>
<li>Transmission Medium</li>
<li>Protocol</li>
</ul>

<h4>Data</h4>
<p>
Communication of data means a message or data will be transmitted from one device and will be received in the destination or target device. Thus the first component in a data communication network is data or message to that needs to be delivered and received. Data or message can be of various forms such as text, audio, video, image or combinations of these forms etc.

</p>

<h4>Sender</h4>
<p>
A data has to be sent to a destination from a source. This source is called the sender. The device that sends the data to the destination or target is the Sender. It can be a computer, cell phone, video camera and so on.
</p>

<h4> Reciever </h4>
<p>
The destination of a transmitted data is the receiver which will receive the data. The device that receives the data that was sent by the Sender is the Receiver. A receiver can again be a computer, cell phone, video camera and so on.
</p>

<h4>Transmission Mediums</h4>
<p>
In data communication network, the transmission medium is the physical path for the data to travel to its destination after being sent by the Sender. Receiver receives the data at one end of this path and the sender sent from another end of the path. Transmission medium could be like twisted-pair cable, coaxial cable, fiber-optic cable etc.
</p>

<h4>Protocols</h4>
<p>
A protocol is nothing but a set of rules that applies on the full data communication procedure. This is like an agreement between the two devices to successfully communicate with each other. For example, how the data will be sent, how the data will be traveling, how to ensure that full data has received, how to handle errors in transmission etc. Both devices follow the same set of rules or protocol so that they understand each other.
