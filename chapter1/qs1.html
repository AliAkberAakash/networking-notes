<div class="ans"><p>
A computer network is a set of connected computers. Computers on a network are called nodes. The connection between computers can be done via cabling, most commonly the Ethernet cable, or wirelessly through radio waves. Connected computers can share resources, like access to the Internet, printers, file servers, and others. A network is a multipurpose connection, which allows a single computer to do more.

A computer network, also referred to as a data network, is a series of interconnected nodes that can transmit, receive and exchange data, voice and video traffic. Network devices use a variety of protocols and algorithms to specify exactly how endpoints should  transmit and receive data. For example, the Ethernet standard establishes a common language for wired networks to communicate, and the 802.11 standard does the same for wireless local area networks (WLANs).
